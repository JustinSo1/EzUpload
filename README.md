## FAQ

- **When I upload images does it count toward the Google Photos storage quota?**
    - Yes, unfortunately. Google Photos API currently only supports uploading images in "Original Quality". To convert to "High Quality", go to `https://photos.google.com/settings` and click the `Recover storage` button
